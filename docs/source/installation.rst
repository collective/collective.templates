You first need to install and activate the Plone add-on. Therefor you had to
go to the Plone 'Site Setup' adminstration area. If you got administration
permissions you find a link to it in the menu entry with your name

to the URL of your Plone site.

In the 'Site Setup' page click on 'Add-ons' and you get a list of the Plone
add-ons which are available in your Plone site.
